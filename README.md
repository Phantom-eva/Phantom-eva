My name is Yilin Li. I have a wide range of interests. I like coding, high tech products, and travel. Also, I play League of Legends, although not very good at it.

You can learn more about me on my personal website and enjoy the pictures I take and the videos I edit.

Times are constantly changing, and what I want to do now is to enjoy my life and embrace the future.
